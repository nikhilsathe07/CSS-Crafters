This code creates a Google Maps Clone UI using HTML and CSS, closely mimicking Google's layout. Below is a detailed breakdown of its structure and functionality:

1. HTML Breakdown
The HTML file is structured into different sections to replicate a Google Maps-like UI.

A. Main Layout (#map)
The main map area (#map) is a full-screen background that would hold the actual map if JavaScript and the Google Maps API were integrated.
B. Search & Controls (#controls)
This section appears at the top of the map and contains:

Search Bar (#search) – For entering locations (currently non-functional).
Traffic Toggle (#trafficToggle) – A button to show/hide live traffic.
Current Location (#currentLocation) – Button to center the map on the user's location.
Route Mode (#routeMode) – Icons to switch between Driving and Transit routes.
C. Map Type Dropdown (#mapTypeDropdown)
A dropdown menu lets users switch between different map views (e.g., Satellite, Terrain, Hybrid).
This mimics Google Maps' map type selector.
D. Left Sidebar (#leftNav)
A collapsible sidebar contains:

Menu Button (#menuButton) – Opens/closes the sidebar.
Saved Places (#savedPlaces) – A placeholder for user-saved locations.
History (#history) – Shows past searches or visited locations.
Login & Logout (#loginButton, #logoutButton) – User authentication buttons.
2. CSS Breakdown
The CSS file styles the UI, making it visually similar to Google Maps.

A. General Styling
Uses Roboto font (similar to Google Maps).
Body has no margins (body { margin: 0; }) for a full-screen effect.
Flexbox (display: flex) is widely used for layout adjustments.
B. Map Styling (#map)
Takes up the entire screen (width: 100vw; height: 100vh;).
Uses a placeholder background color (#e5e3df), but in a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual map.
C. Controls Styling (#controls)
Fixed at the top (position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%);).
Uses border-radius: 5px for rounded edges, giving it a Google-like appearance.
D. Sidebar Styling (#leftNav)
Initially hidden (transform: translateX(-250px);).
Expands when active (transform: translateX(0);).
Uses a sliding effect (transition: 0.3s ease-in-out).
3. Missing Functionality
This UI looks like Google Maps but is not functional yet. For full functionality, we need:

✅ JavaScript Enhancements
Google Maps API – To load the actual map instead of a static background.
Search Functionality – Fetching and displaying search results dynamically.
Traffic & Route Options – Toggling traffic layers and showing real routes.
User Authentication – Logging in and saving user preferences.
Sidebar Interactions – Expanding/collapsing sidebar dynamically.
